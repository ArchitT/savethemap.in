            <h4>Response to the Geospatial Information Regulation Bill, 2016</h4>
            <p>On May 4th, 2016 the Ministry of Home Affairs published a bill that controls the acquisition, dissemination, publication and distribution of geospatial information in and outside India.</p>
            <p>It has serious implications for individuals and businesses who use maps for service delivery in India. The bill is inviting responses until June 4, 2016.</p>
            <button id="send-anchor-mobile" class="button button-primary twelve columns" style="display:none;">Email the Ministry of Home Affairs</button>

        <h5>Response</h5>
        <textarea id="message" class="twelve columns u-max-full-width" style="height: 300px;">
I do not support the current draft of the Geospatial Information Regulation Bill 2016 for the following reasons:

Under this current draft, without a license and vetting of data, I will not be able to do many things, which I do in my day to day life, such as:

I will not be able to geotag photos that I take, and share them with my friends.
I will not be able to geotag my social media posts.
I will not be able to record my daily running, cycling, walking or driving activity with smartphone apps.
I will not be able to share my location with my friends and others via smartphone apps like Whatsapp, food delivery apps, transport apps etc.
I will not be able to use safety apps to share my location, which is a dangerous thing, given the issue of child & women's safety.
I will not be able to have a simple diagram showing the location on my sister's wedding card.

This current draft will dissuade a strong ecosystem of innovation. Please reconsider this current draft in favour of a regulation policy that will encourage all Indians who need and use geospatial data in everyday lives and who work every day to create businesses that serve India.

Thank you.

          <h5>FAQs</h5>
          <h6 class="docs-header">Q: What's the Big Deal about this bill? Isn't this bill about forcing Foreign Map providers to show correct Indian Boundaries?</h6>
          <p>While a section in the bill requires all entities to use and display correct boundaries of the country, the bill as a whole tries to regulate a lot more. It talks about licensing all entities who create, collect, analyse and distribute all kinds of GeoSpatial data. It talks about a bureaucratic committee which will license all such entities, and will Vet all such data after collection and before distributing it. </p>

          <h6 class="docs-header">Q: Why should I be concerned? This will force just the big players like Google, and OSM and Digital Globe to get Licenses right?</h6>
          <p>It might seem that it is only large companies such as Google and Bing Maps who collect and distribute such data, but that is incorrect. When you hail an Uber/Ola by marking your location on a map, you are creating geospatial information. When you take a Geotagged image, you are creating geospatial information. When you "share your location" on WhatsApp with your friend, you're creating and disseminating geospatial information. When you retweet a map or satellite image, you are distributing Geospatial data. You, even as an end user of these apps and services, fall within the scope of multiple provisions of this Act (s.3, s.4), and hence need a licence under this act. </p>

          <h6 class="docs-header">Q: Isn't allowing the General public and private players access to this kind of data a security risk? What's the benefit of the public having access to this kind of data?</h6>
          <p>GeoSpatial data is used by citizens and private organizations from diverse fields and all walks of life. It is used by companies in the Transport, Logistics, Insurance, Construction, Utilities and many other domains. 
          It is used by ordinary villages to find the best place to build check dams to save water; It is used by regular fishermen to go to the place which has the best fish. It is used in emergency situations like the Chennai floods, The Uttarkhand fires, finding trapped Mountaineers as well as Child and women safety trackers.
          Citizens have a right to Information, and Geospatial data is just another kind of Information.</p>

          <h6 class="docs-header">Q: Isn't it a Good Idea to regulate these kinds of players? That way terrorists and Foreign Players will not know about our security installations.</h6>
          <p>In no form does this make the country more secure. These rules will be followed by India citizens, Indian Organizations and Indians outside India(s.1). It's anybody's guess whether foreign citizens and organization will get licensed under this bill, and follow the Terms &amp; Conditions of this Bill. Other countries have their own satellites, and many of them offer this data for download free of cost. Foreign Militaries and foreign supported terrorists will always be able to source their data from outside the country. All that this bill will achieve is to keep Indian Citizens and companies in the dark, and at a disadvantage when compared to International IT and GIS industry.</p>

          <h6 class="docs-header">Q: How will the passage of this Bill harm us? </h6>
          <p>The Central Government talks about Digital India, Startup India, as well as Smart Cities. None of these objectives can be achieved without free and easy access to Geospatial Data. If a farmer cannot access Weather and Soil data for his field, what Digital India are you talking about? If a startup has to get a license and has to get each and every record vetted by a bureaucratic committee, how can it compete on the Global stage? How can you have Smart Cities without IoT sensors providing real time dynamic information of traffic, utilities, transport in our cities? Passage of this bill will bring to a halt, most of modern ITES as well as Location Based Services.</p>

          <h6 class="docs-header">Q: Ok I understand that this bill is Bad. How do we prevent this from becoming law?</h6>
          <p>First and foremost you need to send a reply to the Joint Secretary (Internal Security-I), Ministry of Home Affairs via email at jsis@nic.in within 30 days. We have a ready made email template at the top of this page which you can use with a single click.
          Secondly, please spread awareness about this bill in your network, and ask all to send a response to this bill, explaining why this is a bad idea, and why it’s a mistake for the MHA to even consider this bill in its current state. </p>
